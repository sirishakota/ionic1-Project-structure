      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions
        than other languages.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">History of Python Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Python Features Python's features include:</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Easy-to-learn: Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Easy-to-read: Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Easy-to-maintain: Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">A broad standard library: Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Interactive Mode:Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Portable: Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Extendable: You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Databases: Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">GUI Programming: Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Scalable: Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below:</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">IT supports automatic garbage collection.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</p>
